# LinkedIn Job Filter - Chrome Extension

I was extremely tired of seeing  spammy recruiter posts, and irrelevant job listings clutter my LinkedIn Jobs feed. So I created a lightweight tool that detects these keywords and hides those posts instantly.

## Installation

## Usage

1. Navigate to LinkedIn job listings (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/`)
2. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. Enter keywords you want to filter out (e.g., "contractor", "recruiter", "part-time")
4. Click "Add" to add the keyword to your filter list
5. Jobs containing any of your keywords will be automatically hidden
6. Use "Remove" to delete individual keywords or "Clear All" to remove all filters
